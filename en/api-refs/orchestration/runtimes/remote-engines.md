# Remote Engines
Remote Engines are engines that you can install or deploy remotely on your secure servers or in other places that are not Talend Cloud, while they are still bound to your Talend Cloud deployment. You can use them for many things, including executing jobs or pipelines that will process high amounts or highly critical data.

You can learn more about Remote Engines by reading the dedicated documentation on [Talend Help Center](http://www.help.talend.com).
